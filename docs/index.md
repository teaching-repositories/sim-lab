# SimLab Overview

Welcome to the documentation for the SimLab framework. This framework includes several simulation models that are designed to demonstrate and analyze various phenomena in business and economics. Here, you will find detailed information on the workings and usage of each simulation model.

### Product Popularity Simulation

The Product Popularity Simulation models the dynamics of product demand over time, considering factors like natural growth, marketing impact, and promotional campaigns.

### Stock Market Simulation

The Stock Market Simulation provides a framework for modeling and predicting stock price movements based on various economic and psychological factors.

### Resource Fluctuations Simulation

The Resource Fluctuations Simulation models the price variability of resources over time, factoring in elements like market volatility, economic drift, and external disruptions.

### Modelling Market Dynamics

Each model incorporates different aspects of market behavior and is linked to classical and traditional models in economics and finance.  See [Modelling Market Dynamics](./simulations/basic/modelling_market_dynamics.md)
