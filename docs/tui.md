```

## Interface Overview

The TUI is organized into several screens:

1. **Welcome Screen**: Choose a simulation type
2. **Parameter Forms**: Configure simulation parameters
3. **Results Screen**: View simulation results and save data

### Navigation

- Use **Tab** to navigate between fields
- Use **Enter** to activate buttons
- Use **Arrow Keys** to move between options and navigate widgets
