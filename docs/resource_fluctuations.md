# Resource Fluctuation Simulation

## Purpose

This simulation models the price fluctuations of a critical resource for a business. It is applicable to commodities, raw materials, or any essential business input, helping students understand market dynamics and pricing strategies.

## Parameters

- `start_price`: The initial price of the resource.
- `days`: The duration of the simulation.
- `volatility`: Controls the severity of day-to-day price fluctuations.
- `drift`: Indicates the general upward or downward trend in price over time.
- `supply_disruption_day`: Specifies the day on which a supply disruption event occurs (optional).
- `disruption_severity`: The magnitude of the supply disruption's impact on the price, positive indicating a shortage and negative indicating a surplus.


**Example Code**

```python
from simulacra import ResourceFluctuationsSimulation
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Setting up a moderate volatility and upward drift scenario with a supply disruption.
sim = ResourceFluctuationsSimulation(start_price=100, days=250, volatility=0.015, 
                         drift=0.0003, supply_disruption_day=100, disruption_severity=0.3) 

prices = sim.run_simulation()

# Visualising the price simulation
plt.figure(figsise=(10, 6))
plt.plot(prices, label='Resource Price')
plt.axvline(x=sim.supply_disruption_day, color='r', linestyle='--', label='Supply Disruption')
plt.xlabel('Days')
plt.ylabel('Price')
plt.title('Resource Price Simulation')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```
## Conducting Visual Analysis Using the Simulation:

Experiment! Use the simulation to explore and test various scenarios. Adjust parameters, try different strategies, and analyse the outcomes to gain deeper insights into resource management under fluctuating conditions.

- **Baseline Scenario Without Disruptions**: Begin by simulating the price path without any disruptions to establish a baseline for comparison with more complex scenarios.
  
- **Labeling and Annotations**: Ensure that your plots clearly show the days on the x-axis and price on the y-axis. Use lines or markers to indicate the day of a supply disruption or the implementation of a hedging strategy.

- **Interactive Exploration**: If tools are available, adjust parameters such as volatility and drift dynamically to observe how these changes affect the price simulation. This can help in understanding the immediate effects of each parameter.

- **Comparative Analysis**: Conduct side-by-side comparisons of scenarios with different levels of volatility or different strategies to visually assess their impact. This can make it easier to understand which conditions or strategies lead to the most favorable outcomes.  Consider calculating and comparing statistics such as the average price before and after a disruption event to quantify its impact.


## Task Specific Guidance

### Assess the Impact of Volatility on Price Stability:

Start by exploring how different levels of volatility affect day-to-day price fluctuations. This will help you understand the sensitivity of resource prices to changes in market conditions. Questions to Consider:

  - What trends do you notice as volatility increases? How does it affect the predictability of price movements?
  - How do different volatility levels impact the overall risk profile of investing in this resource?

### Model a Supply Disruption Event and Analyse Its Impact

Set up scenarios where a supply disruption occurs at a predetermined day. Change the severity of these disruptions to see how they influence resource prices. Questions to Consider:

  - How does the timing of a supply disruption affect its impact on resource prices?
  - Compare the prices before and after the disruption. What can you infer about the resilience of the market to sudden changes?

### (Optional) Explore Hedging Strategies

Implement simple hedging strategies to see how they could mitigate the risks associated with price volatility and supply disruptions. Consider strategies like futures contracts or options.Questions to Consider:

  - Which hedging strategy appears most effective in stabilising price fluctuations?
  - How do the costs of these strategies compare to their benefits in terms of reduced price volatility?
