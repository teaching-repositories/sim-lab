    """
    A simulation class to model the dynamics of product popularity over time,
    incorporating factors like natural growth, marketing impact, and promotional campaigns.

    Attributes:
        start_demand (int): Initial demand for the product.
        days (int): Duration of the simulation in days.
        growth_rate (float): Natural growth rate of product demand.
        marketing_impact (float): Impact of ongoing marketing efforts on demand.
        promotion_day (Optional[int]): Day on which a major marketing campaign starts (default is None).
        promotion_effectiveness (float): Effectiveness of the marketing campaign.
        random_seed (Optional[int]): The seed for the random number generator to ensure reproducibility (default is None).

    Methods:
        run_simulation(): Runs the simulation and returns a list of demand values over time.
