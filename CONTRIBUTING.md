## How to Contribute

### Issues

- **Report a Bug:** If you're experiencing a problem, please check the [issue tracker](https://github.com/teaching-repositories/sim-lab/issues) to see if it has already been reported. If not, open a new issue with a descriptive title, a detailed description of the problem, and steps to reproduce it.
- **Request a Feature:** Have an idea for a new feature? Check the issue tracker to see if it has already been suggested, and if not, you can open a new issue to describe your idea.

### Pull Requests

1. **Fork the Repository:** Start by forking the repository on GitHub.
2. **Clone Your Fork:** Use `git clone` to bring a copy of your fork to your local machine.
3. **Create a New Branch:** Make a new branch for your changes. Naming it something descriptive about the change can be helpful, like `fix-resource-calculation` or `add-stock-simulation-feature`.
4. **Make Your Changes:** Implement your changes in your branch. Be sure to keep your changes focused. If you find other issues or improvements to make, consider making a separate branch and pull request.
5. **Test Your Changes:** Ensure your changes do not break existing functionality. Add new tests if your changes include new functionality.
6. **Commit Your Changes:** Use meaningful commit messages that explain your changes. 
7. **Push to GitHub:** Push your changes to your fork on GitHub.
8. **Submit a Pull Request:** Go to the original repository on GitHub and you'll see a prompt to submit a pull request from your new branch. Fill in the details, linking any relevant issues.
