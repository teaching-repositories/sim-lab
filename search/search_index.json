Each model incorporates different aspects of market behavior and is loosley linked to traditional models in economics and finance. Product Popularity The formula used in the ProductPopularitySimulation class for simulating product demand appears to incorporate several key factors: natural growth, marketing impact, and promotional campaigns. Here's a breakdown of how the formula works for each day of the simulation: Natural Growth: The natural growth of the product's demand is modeled as a simple exponential growth, which is a common model in population dynamics and economics. Each day, the demand increases by a percentage defined by the growth_rate attribute. The formula for this part is: \\[ \\text{Natural Growth} = \\text{Previous Demand} \\times (1 + \\text{Growth Rate}) \\] Marketing Impact: On top of the natural growth, the formula also includes a daily impact from ongoing marketing efforts. This impact is additive and is calculated as a percentage of the previous day's demand, determined by the marketing_impact attribute: \\[ \\text{Marketing Influence} = \\text{Previous Demand} \\times \\text{Marketing Impact} \\] Promotional Campaign: If a promotional campaign occurs on a specific day (defined by promotion_day ), the demand for that day is further increased by a factor of promotion_effectiveness . This is modeled as a multiplicative boost to the demand calculated from natural growth and marketing influence: \\[ \\text{New Demand} = (\\text{Natural Growth} + \\text{Marketing Influence}) \\times (1 + \\text{Promotion Effectiveness}) \\] The overall formula for days without a promotional campaign is: \\[ \\text{New Demand} = \\text{Natural Growth} + \\text{Marketing Influence} \\] For the day with the promotional campaign, the formula changes as mentioned above. Relation to Classical Models The model presented in the ProductPopularitySimulation class is not based directly on any classical single formula but instead combines concepts from various fields like marketing theory, economics, and systems dynamics: - The exponential growth model for natural increase is classical in many biological and economic models. - The impact of marketing as an additive factor is a straightforward approach often used in preliminary marketing models. - The multiplicative effect of a special promotion is also commonly used in models assessing the impact of irregular or one-time events on ongoing processes. The combination of these elements into a single model for simulating product demand helps in understanding how different factors interact over time to influence the market dynamics of a product. It's a practical approach that allows for adjustments and analysis of individual components like marketing strategies and promotional campaigns. This type of model can be very useful in academic settings or business analytics to forecast product demand under varying scenarios. Resource Fluctuations The formula used in the ResourceFluctuationsSimulation class is designed to simulate the fluctuations in resource prices, incorporating daily volatility, a trend or drift over time, and the effects of supply disruptions. Here's a breakdown of how the formula works for each day of the simulation: Volatility and Drift: Each day, the price of the resource changes based on a combination of volatility and drift. The volatility represents the day-to-day variability in price changes, while the drift represents a consistent trend in price changes over time. This is modeled using a normal distribution where the mean of the distribution is given by the drift and the standard deviation by the volatility . This is expressed as: \\[ \\text{Random Change} = \\text{Normal}(\\text{Drift}, \\text{Volatility}) \\] Then, the new price is calculated as: \\[ \\text{New Price} = \\text{Previous Price} \\times (1 + \\text{Random Change}) \\] Supply Disruption: If there's a day specified for a supply disruption (given by supply_disruption_day ), the formula adjusts the price of the resource significantly based on the disruption_severity . The severity is modeled as a multiplicative factor to the price of the resource: \\[ \\text{New Price} = \\text{Previous Price} \\times (1 + \\text{Disruption Severity}) \\] Relation to Classical Models The simulation model appears to draw from the classical geometric Brownian motion (GBM) model, which is commonly used in financial mathematics to model stock prices and other financial assets. In GBM, the logarithm of the stock prices follows a Brownian motion (also known as a Wiener process) with drift and volatility, similar to the structure used in this resource simulation class: Geometric Brownian Motion: The use of previous_price * (1 + random_change) closely resembles the discrete approximation of GBM, where price changes are log-normally distributed, allowing the price to stay positive and fluctuate in a realistic manner. Supply Disruption as a Jump Process: The inclusion of supply disruption as a multiplicative effect on the price for a specific day can be seen as a form of a jump process, where the price can have sudden, significant changes due to external events. This is similar to models used in energy markets and commodities trading, where sudden events can cause significant price changes. Overall, while the exact parameters and implementation details might differ based on the simulation's objectives and the specific market being modeled, the underlying principles of the formula are well-established in the field of quantitative finance and economic modeling. Stock Market The formula used in the StockMarketSimulation class simulates stock price movements by incorporating volatility, a directional trend (drift), and the impact of specific market events. Here\u2019s a detailed explanation of the components of the formula: Volatility and Drift: Similar to the Resource Fluctuations Simulation, the stock price changes are driven by daily volatility and drift. Each day, the stock price undergoes a random change determined by a normal distribution centered around the drift (which can be positive or negative to represent an overall upward or downward trend) and spread according to the volatility (which accounts for the unpredictability or risk associated with the stock). This is mathematically modeled as: \\[ \\text{Random Change} = \\text{Normal}(\\text{Drift}, \\text{Volatility}) \\] The new price for each day is then calculated as: \\[ \\text{New Price} = \\text{Previous Price} \\times (1 + \\text{Random Change}) \\] Market Event Impact: If there is a significant market event planned for a specific day ( event_day ), the stock price is adjusted to reflect the impact of this event using the event_impact , which is applied as a multiplicative factor.

In GBM, prices are assumed to follow a log-normal distribution, ensuring that they remain positive and reflect realistic financial scenarios where prices are multiplicative. Event Modeling: The handling of specific market events by applying a multiplicative impact on the stock price for a particular day resembles a jump-diffusion model . This type of model is often used to incorporate sudden, significant changes in price due to external factors (such as corporate news, geopolitical events, etc.), which aren\u2019t captured by the standard GBM. Overall, the simulation combines elements from established financial models to allow for dynamic and realistic modeling of stock prices, accommodating both the continuous aspect of daily price changes and discrete events that can significantly affect market conditions. This approach is quite common in financial market simulations used for educational purposes, trading strategy development, and risk management. Conclusion The simulation models developed for analyzing product popularity, resource fluctuations, and stock market dynamics provide valuable insights into the complex interactions within markets. By relating these models to classical and traditional theories, we can better understand the underlying mechanisms and potentially predict future behaviors under various scenarios.","title":"Modelling Market Dynamics"},{"location":"modelling_market_dynamics/#modeling-market-dynamics","text":"This document provides a detailed overview and comparative analysis of the simulation models developed for understanding the dynamics of product popularity, stock market, and resource price fluctuations.

Here's a breakdown of how the formula works for each day of the simulation: Natural Growth: The natural growth of the product's demand is modeled as a simple exponential growth, which is a common model in population dynamics and economics. Each day, the demand increases by a percentage defined by the growth_rate attribute. The formula for this part is: \\[ \\text{Natural Growth} = \\text{Previous Demand} \\times (1 + \\text{Growth Rate}) \\] Marketing Impact: On top of the natural growth, the formula also includes a daily impact from ongoing marketing efforts. This impact is additive and is calculated as a percentage of the previous day's demand, determined by the marketing_impact attribute: \\[ \\text{Marketing Influence} = \\text{Previous Demand} \\times \\text{Marketing Impact} \\] Promotional Campaign: If a promotional campaign occurs on a specific day (defined by promotion_day ), the demand for that day is further increased by a factor of promotion_effectiveness . This is modeled as a multiplicative boost to the demand calculated from natural growth and marketing influence: \\[ \\text{New Demand} = (\\text{Natural Growth} + \\text{Marketing Influence}) \\times (1 + \\text{Promotion Effectiveness}) \\] The overall formula for days without a promotional campaign is: \\[ \\text{New Demand} = \\text{Natural Growth} + \\text{Marketing Influence} \\] For the day with the promotional campaign, the formula changes as mentioned above.","title":"Product Popularity"},{"location":"modelling_market_dynamics/#relation-to-classical-models","text":"The model presented in the ProductPopularitySimulation class is not based directly on any classical single formula but instead combines concepts from various fields like marketing theory, economics, and systems dynamics: - The exponential growth model for natural increase is classical in many biological and economic models. - The impact of marketing as an additive factor is a straightforward approach often used in preliminary marketing models. - The multiplicative effect of a special promotion is also commonly used in models assessing the impact of irregular or one-time events on ongoing processes. The combination of these elements into a single model for simulating product demand helps in understanding how different factors interact over time to influence the market dynamics of a product. It's a practical approach that allows for adjustments and analysis of individual components like marketing strategies and promotional campaigns. This type of model can be very useful in academic settings or business analytics to forecast product demand under varying scenarios.","title":"Relation to Classical Models"},{"location":"modelling_market_dynamics/#resource-fluctuations","text":"The formula used in the ResourceFluctuationsSimulation class is designed to simulate the fluctuations in resource prices, incorporating daily volatility, a trend or drift over time, and the effects of supply disruptions. Here's a breakdown of how the formula works for each day of the simulation: Volatility and Drift: Each day, the price of the resource changes based on a combination of volatility and drift. The volatility represents the day-to-day variability in price changes, while the drift represents a consistent trend in price changes over time. This is modeled using a normal distribution where the mean of the distribution is given by the drift and the standard deviation by the volatility . This is expressed as: \\[ \\text{Random Change} = \\text{Normal}(\\text{Drift}, \\text{Volatility}) \\] Then, the new price is calculated as: \\[ \\text{New Price} = \\text{Previous Price} \\times (1 + \\text{Random Change}) \\] Supply Disruption: If there's a day specified for a supply disruption (given by supply_disruption_day ), the formula adjusts the price of the resource significantly based on the disruption_severity .

Supply Disruption as a Jump Process: The inclusion of supply disruption as a multiplicative effect on the price for a specific day can be seen as a form of a jump process, where the price can have sudden, significant changes due to external events. This is similar to models used in energy markets and commodities trading, where sudden events can cause significant price changes.
